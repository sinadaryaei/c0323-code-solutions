## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?

    The purpose of a loop is to run a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.


- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?

    The purpose of a **condition** expression is to evalutate
    true or false. It used to see if it needs to exit the loop
    and if the condition is true the loop will continue,
    if condition is false the loo will exit.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?

    "Iteration" means its going through each step of a loop, for example going through each item in a list one by one.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

    The **condition** expression of a `while` loop gets checked at the beginning of each iteration, before the loop's code runs.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

    The **initialization** expression of a `for` loop happens first, before the loop's code starts. It's like setting things up / packing your backpack before heading out.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

    The **condition** expression of a `for` loop is check at the start of each iteration, before the loop starts.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

    The **final** expression of a `for` loop gets executed at the end of the iteration. It's like doing cooling down end of the day.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

    The keyword `break`.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?

    The increment `++` operator adds 1 to a variable.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?

    The `for...in` loop iterates thorught the keys of an object.
